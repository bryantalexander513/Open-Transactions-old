transactionscom.xml is actually a signed contract, so it will work.

silver.xml and tokens.xml are also signed. But unlike the server contract, 
they are signed by the USER. That's because it's users who issue currencies,
not the server.  So if you wipe all the certs and recreate them, be warned,
you will not be able to use these currency contracts for ISSUING anymore.

You will still be able to use them for creating asset accounts of the same
type, but you will NOT be able to use them for issuing new asset types.

This is because the contract key INSIDE the contract is the same one that
was used to sign the contract.  ONLY that user can issue the curency, though
ANY other user can open an asset account to TRADE in that currency.

To sign a contract with the wallet:

1) Load the wallet up and connect to the server.

2) type "signcontract" and the wallet will ask you to enter an unsigned contract.

3) The new signed contract will be displayed on the screen.

4) From there, you can copy that, and issue a currency by typing "issue". It will 
   ask you to enter the (signed) currency contract, then send a message to the server
   in order to create the new asset type.


There is also a signcontract command line utility.
