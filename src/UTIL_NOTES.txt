createmint

Whenever a new asset type is created (issued by a user) the server needs
to create the mint to go along with it. The problem is, the key generation takes
a long time -- so I put it in a separate process ("createmint".)

For now, after you issue an asset type, you need to run createmint by hand
on the server side if you want to do withdrawals and deposits with that digital 
asset type.

In a future version, the server will fire off createmint automatically whenever
an asset type is created. The user can then use the show_mint.ot script to get
a copy of the file.
The "get mint" won't work right away (there will be a period while the keys are
generated.) But after a while it WILL start to work, and then the user can grab
the mint file, and then he can make withdrawal requests in that asset type.
