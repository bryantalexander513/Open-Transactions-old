<condition name="backing">
  Neither Digitalis Data Services, nor SourceForge, actually issue the
  currencies or digital assets, and they do not back any of the same. 
  You are solely responsible for whom you choose to trade with. 
  This is a demo server, for demonstration purposes. Anyone can issue
  assets here so don't expect any of them to be valid or valuable
  assets. No illegal assets, unregistered securities etcetera
  etcetera etcetera allowed. Assets subject to delisting at any
  time on receipt of court order, whim of operator, fluke, mood,
  act of deity, force majeure etctera etcetera etcetera.
</condition>

<condition name="audit">
  Open Transactions software is open source, and
  code audits are randomly performed by hackers in the 
  open source community. Fellow Traveler (the author of the
  software) also uses Valgrind. 
</condition>

<condition name="rate">
  Hopefully at some point some kind of fee structure will be
  implemented to support the running of the server. Actually
  this will be Real Soon Now, and by the time you read this
  may well already be in effect. So plan on buying some
  usage tokens, probably using bitNicKeLs for the purpose
  (as that is the kind of purpose for which bitNicKeLs were
  intended).
</condition>

<condition name="liability">
  Issuers are solely liable to perform according to
  the conditions specified in their asset contracts.
  But since this is a demo server be prepared for them
  to demonstrate flight by night, ponzi/gold-games,
  and various other scams.
</condition>

<condition name="mint">
  Float - the total quantity of any digital asset outstanding -
  is created by the issuer from his own mint, and signed by his
  private key.

  Disbursements from the Mint account are to be made on receipt of
  duly signed and public authorization from the Issuer.  All
  disbursements from the Mint account are to be made to the single
  Currency Comptroller account identified by the authorization.

  From time to time, the Currency Comptroller may direct the
  Currency Manager to return digital assets to the Mint
  for the express purpose of reducing the float. Digital assets
  so delivered are to be deposited into the Mint account,
  thus reducing the float by that amount.
</condition>

<condition name="privacy">
  The purchase, redemption and trading at OTdemo server
  normally are done on the basis of demonstration. We try to
  demonstrate such capabilities. Gosh knows whether anyone
  using this server will actually do such things "right" or
  "responsibly" or in a "satisfactory" way. Anyone might
  tell anyone anything, expecting privacy in a wild west
  free-for-all would maybe be kind of silly or foolish.
</condition>
