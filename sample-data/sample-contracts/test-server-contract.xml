<condition name="backing">
  Neither FellowTraveler, nor Open Transactions, actually issue any
  currencies or digital assets, and does not back any of the same. 
  You are solely responsible for whom you choose to trade with. 
</condition>

<condition name="audit">
  Open Transactions software is open source, and
  code audits are randomly performed by hackers in the 
  open source community. Fellow Traveler also uses Valgrind. 
</condition>

<condition name="rate">
  There is no rate: I wrote this as free software for the open source
  community. However, funding or coding contributions are welcome. 
</condition>

<condition name="liability">
  Issuers are solely liable to perform according to
  the conditions specified in their asset contracts.
</condition>

<condition name="mint">
  Float - the total quantity of any digital asset outstanding -
  is created by the issuer from his own mint, and signed by his private key.
  
  Disbursements from the Mint account are to be made on receipt of
  duly signed and public authorization from the Issuer.  All
  disbursements from the Mint account are to be made to the single
  Currency Comptroller account identified by the authorization.

  From time to time, the Currency Comptroller may direct the
  Currency Manager to return digital assets to the Mint
  for the express purpose of reducing the float. Digital assets
  so delivered are to be deposited into the Mint account,
  thus reducing the float by that amount.
</condition>

<condition name="privacy">
  The purchase, redemption and trading at Transactions.com normally
  are done on the basis of strong privacy. We will never release any of
  your information unless compelled by law.
