So far, this directory should have a Makefile, and some configuration files

The config files have .cnf as the extension.

The Makefile needs them to be there.  It goes through and creates all the various keys
and certs and client/server CA keys blah blah.

This is all just for testing for right now.  Use this folder to create your keys.
Edit the configure files first, all that you want, then run Make.

-----

In addition to the Makefile and the .cnf files, which you should never erase,
you may also notice some .pem files and so on.  That's because I generated some
test certs to go with the distribution.

THE PASSWORD, FOR ALL CERTS, IS test (LOWER CASE).
