DONE:
Valgrind scan and numerous fixes stemming from it, a year ago.

TODO:
Need to do another Valgrind scan. It's been a while.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER static analyzers we should be using?


TODO: grep the code for todos and security notes and fix them all.

TODO: Look up the standard security rules and make sure we're compliant
with everything. See notes in OTPassword.h/cpp

TODO: code audit (by outside experts.)

DONE:
OTPassword class. This is a 128-byte (configurable) space which
zeros itself out in its destructor. Care is taken to insure that
the memory is actually zeroed out, and not left intact due to some
compiler optimization etc.

TODO:
Make sure that ALL passphrases in OT are handled with OTPassword. I
exposed it in SWIG also, so I need to make sure the SWIG-generated
version uses char[] instead of String, and that the char[] is properly
disposed of.  Need to make sure no Java Strings in Moneychanger are
storing any private keys or passphrases.



TODO: Make sure all files, where necessary, are signed. Should they 
also be encrypted, or should we leave that to the filesystem?
