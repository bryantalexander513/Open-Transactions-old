resync.ot
Although the code has now been improved to the point where you shouldn't get
out  of sync, here is a script (resync.ot) that will re-synchronize your Nym
if he ever somehow misses a server reply. (You shouldn't ever need it, but
it's a tool.)


adjust_usage.ot
If the server has usage credits turned ON, this script can be used to view
your usage credits, or if you are the override Nym on the server, you can use
this script to adjust the usage credits on any Nyms registered at your server.
