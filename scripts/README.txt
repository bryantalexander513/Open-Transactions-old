The 'ot' folder contains the actual ot header 'include' scripts. OT includes these
automatically at the top of any OT script, and they provide an "ULTRA-HIGH-LEVEL"
wrapper, in the OT script language (chaiscript), making OT trivially easy to use.

The 'samples' folder contains short examples of this high-level API wrapper in
action. There is also a Java version of the same object, now on display in the 
Moneychanger project.

Not only do you have access to this "ultra- high-level API" but also the 
entire regular OT API is fully accessible from within the ot scripts. For
more on that, see: 
https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki/API 

The 'util' folder is where we will collect various utility scripts, such
as the resync script.
