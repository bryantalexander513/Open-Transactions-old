 *   ADDITIONAL PERMISSION under the GNU Affero GPL version 3
 *   section 7: (This paragraph applies only to the LAGPLv3
 *   components listed above.) If you modify this Program, or
 *   any covered work, by linking or combining it with other
 *   code, such other code is not for that reason alone subject
 *   to any of the requirements of the GNU Affero GPL version 3.
 *   (==> This means if you are only using the OT-API, then you
 *   don't have to open-source your code--only your changes to
 *   Open Transactions itself must be open source. Similar to
 *   LGPLv3, except it applies to software-as-a-service, not

 *
 *   Extra WAIVER for OpenSSL, Lucre, and all other libraries
 *   used by Open Transactions: This program is released under
 *   the AGPL with the additional exemption that compiling,
 *   linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed. The same is true
 *   for any other open source libraries included in this
 *   project: complete waiver from the AGPL is hereby granted to
 *   compile, link, and/or use them with Open Transactions,
 *   according to their own terms, as long as the rest of the
 *   Open Transactions terms remain respected, with regard to
 *   the Open Transactions code itself.
 *    
 *   Lucre License:
 *   This code is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Lau-
 *   rie's license must also be included and respected, since
 *   the code for Lucre is also included with Open Transactions.
 *   See Open-Transactions/OTLib/Lucre/LUCRE_LICENSE.txt
 *   The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any
 *   problem with his license, simply remove the Lucre code.
 *   Although there are no other blind token algorithms in Open
 *   Transactions (yet. credlib is coming), the other functions
 *   will continue to operate.

#ifndef __OT_PASSWORD_H__

/*
 To use:
 
 OTPassword thePass;
 (Or...)
 OTPassword thePass(strPassword, strPassword.length());
 
 const char * szPassword	= thePass.getPassword();
 const int    nPassLength	= thePass.getPasswordSize();
 
 If the instance of OTPassword is not going to be destroyed immediately
 after the password is used, then make sure to call zeroMemory() after
 using the password. (Otherwise the destructor will handle this anyway.)
 
 (The primary purpose of this class is that it zeros its memory out when
 it is destructed.)
 
 This class gives me a safe way to hand-off a password, and off-load the
 handling risk to the user.  This class will be included as part of the
 OT-API SWIG interface so that it's available inside other languages.
